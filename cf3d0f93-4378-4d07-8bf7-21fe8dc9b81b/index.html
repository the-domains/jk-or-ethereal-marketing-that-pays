<p><i><i><i></i></i></i></p><p><i><i><i>“We no longer make or move things; we apply knowledge to knowledge.”</i></i></i></p><p>Peter Drucker</p><p>Events - the decision-maker’s number one choice. Exhibitions and events represent a truly an outstanding marketing opportunity.</p><p>Exhibitions and events are the best face-to-face marketing opportunity for companies around the world. They provide outstanding sales, marketing, research, branding and financial rewards for companies that understand some important exhibition marketing fundamentals.</p><p>Executive decision-makers consistently rank exhibitions as their “Number One” choice for obtaining purchasing information -- beating 12 other business media choices, including direct mail, advertising, telemarketing and even email marketing. Exhibitions are the only sales and marketing medium that delivers a pre-qualified visitor to your company’s stand in a face-to-face selling environment. And these visitors invest their own valuable time and expenses to be at the exhibition.</p><p>Peter Drucker, in his book Post Capitalist Society, calls this new century the age of specialisation and knowledge. “We no longer make or move things; we apply knowledge to knowledge.” </p><p>Exhibitions and events are the prime opportunity to accomplish this.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/94ba03b1-f821-4863-87de-2fcc028bbe83.jpg"><p><b>Events. Multiply your success by three.</b><br>Think about your next event in three phases. Before the event, excite your existing and prospective customers about 'what's in it for them' - to compel them to come to your event. Make that invitation really sizzle.</p><p>On the day, deliver a memorable experience or insight with take-aways the audience can share and collect as much contact information as you politely can.<br>After the event thank all those who came and reveal to those who were not able to be there, what the special thing was that event attendees got, and offer that opportunity again.<br><b></b></p><p><b>How to create a compelling event</b></p><p>Set some objectives for the event. Perhaps you want to create some awareness about a new product or service – or just for your company in general?</p><p>Do you want to develop relationships with prospects, or meet with potential partners or third-parties?</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Typical objectives are any combination of the following:</b></p><ul><li>increase sales through new orders or qualified trade show leads</li><li>introduce new products or services</li><li>enhance your relationships with current customers</li><li>conduct market research</li><li>obtain contact names for the company’s e-mail list</li><li>open new markets or territories</li><li>gain media exposure</li><li>check out the competition</li><li>enhance the company image or brand</li><li>conduct sales meetings in conjunction with the exhibit</li><li>provide education to the visitors</li><li>recruit new employees</li></ul><p>Relating this back to your objectives, decide what you want to be saying to you customers and prospects at the show.</p><p>Avoid the “Our XY widget is the fastest in the industry and is accredited to ISO 45786” type of messages.</p><p>Instead, promote the advantages and benefits your customers will see if they use your service or product:</p><p>- “The XY widget will speed up your Z process, meaning you spend less time on admin and more time selling to clients”.</p><p>Above all else, consider what it is that will be compelling enough about your stand to make your prospects want to stop, pick up some literature and talk to a member of your staff.</p><picture>

<p><b>Before the event - getting people to come to your stand</b></p><p>Start to plan how you will promote your attendance at the show so that it will encourage potential customers to come along and see you there.</p><p>Apart from emailing or posting invitations to your known contacts, what else will you do?</p><p>If you have a company e-newsletter, then plan to write a few articles about the show in the run up to it so that your readers know you will be there. If the show is using social media, “like” its Facebook page, join its LinkedIn group and follow its Twitter account, and then start to engage with other exhibitors and visitors.</p><p>Add the show logo and the news that you’ll be there to the front page of your website. Check if there are any marketing activities being arranged by the organisers and see how you can tap into those.</p><p><b>Invitations </b></p><p>Use your customer and prospect databases to invite your contacts to the show.</p><p>For the lowest cost, email is best. For the highest impact consider a directly mailed invitation pack. Write to your contacts as soon as you book your stand to tell them to save the date; then send a reminder email nearer the time.</p><p>Update the audience with any special offers, draws or promotions you’re running at the show.</p><p><b>Website </b></p><p>Add the show’s logo (with the organisers’ permission, of course) to your website, and link through to details about the stand. Write a blog/email piece about your presence at the exhibition, telling your readers all about what you’ll be offering or promoting.</p><p><b>Public relations (PR)</b></p><p>If you are running a competition or making a special offer on your stand, then write and send a press release to the industry press.</p><p>Find out from the organisers which press will be attending the event and send them your release.</p><p>If applicable, offer them an interview with a senior member of staff at the show itself.</p><p>If there will be a press office at the exhibition, prepare some press packs for editors.</p><p><b>Twitter</b></p><p>Most exhibitions now have official Twitter accounts, so make sure you are following the official account for the show, as it will also be followed by prospective visitors.</p><p>You can then follow the show’s followers, and start to engage with prospective visitors and other exhibitors.</p><p>And ask PR to tweet every so often about the show, saying you will be attending, using the PHE hashtag. (<a href="https://twitter.com/PHE_uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@PHE_uk</a>)</p><p><b>Facebook </b></p><p>“Like” the show’s official Facebook page if it has one and join in the conversations on the page’s wall.</p><p>On your business page, add links to content about the show, such as your own blog pieces and news on the event’s website.</p><p><b>LinkedIn</b></p><p>For the larger exhibition, there may be a LinkedIn group you can join where you can post your own promotions and join the discussions.</p><p>Via your personal LinkedIn profile, promote occasionally that you will be exhibiting.</p><p><b>Other social media</b></p><p>If your prospects and customers can also be found on other social media such as Google+, YouTube, SlideShare, Scribd, and Flickr, for example, then create content such as videos, photos, documents, presentations and articles and post them on these social media too.</p><p><b>Other</b></p><p>Check with the organisers whether there are any advertising opportunities – perhaps advertising on the website, or in a show programme, or sponsoring a leaflet, and so on.</p><p><b>Networking</b></p><p>Attend any pre- or post- exhibition get-togethers and social events, plus any networking events taking place during the show.</p><p>And don’t forget to mention you’ll be exhibiting at any other business networking you go to.</p><p><b>Leaflets </b></p><p>Have some leaflets printed, promoting your attendance at the exhibition, and highlighting any special offers.</p><p>You can mail these to customers and prospects</p><p><b>On the Day - attracting visitors to your stand</b></p><p>Successful exhibition stands are those that get their message over quickly and simply. Make sure the service offer is clear to any passer-by and expresses a compelling benefit. (i.e. the UK’s leading radiation protection services is our proposition and ‘ we provide the highest quality radiation protection advice, services and training’ is the service benefit, and is our ‘unique selling proposition’).</p><p>Most exhibition attendees are looking for new, innovative and workable solutions to business challenges. So develop intriguing and well-researched topics that will excite your target audience and demonstrate that you have the solutions to some of your industry’s most important challenges. Deliver this knowledge through seminars, white papers, consultancy services or other method to help derive more understanding about how our potential customers link (their perception of) our expertise to their organisational needs.</p><p><b>Engaging visitors at your stand</b></p><p><b>Refreshments</b></p><p>It can be quite hard or time consuming to get really good refreshments at events, provide great refreshments and you’re offering something most people will want and really enjoy. Who wouldn’t swap their business card for an ice-fresh, fresh orange juice drink or a pure-ground coffee that’s the very best there is? It’s also an excellent conversation starter. (we offer the very best advice, services, products and training - so our event refreshments have to be the very best too.)</p><p><b>Videos</b></p><p>A high-quality video is eye-catching, stimulating and informative. Be sure to include a call-to-action such as “take one of our leaflets” or “scan this QR-code to send us an email”.</p><p><b>Interactivity</b></p><p>Technology and cool gadgets not only help attract visitors to a stand, they can also be a great way of gathering contact details, completing surveys and demonstrating services. People are far more likely to leave their contact details on an iPad or tablet than a long paper form.</p><p><b>Literature</b></p><p>The stand has a strong, single-minded proposition that’s clearly understood by all who see it. Provide well deigned literate to support the brand’s event proposition. It will inspire confidence and encourage conversation. Provide pocketable information as well as high quality brochures. Put business cards together with promotional items in a prominent place.</p><p><b>Promotional items</b></p><p>What special offer or compelling hook will you give to make people want to come and see you?</p><p>I would urge you to think beyond just giving away a discount as this could devalue you and your business.</p><p>Instead, consider giving away one of your services or products or training courses as a competition prize in a free draw?</p><p>That way, you will know that everyone who enters the competition is really interested in your product or service because they are keen to win it.</p><p>They may not be interested in paying for it – or they may not have the budget for it at the moment – but by entering, they are showing they want it.</p><p>That means you’re already half way there with them because they’re a part-qualified prospect.</p><p>Be innovative; offer them a gift that they can use. For example a branded USB key with the PHE logo and your service name and website. Put information onto it about your services. In return the prospect will be willing to answer some questions about their organisation and its needs, making it possible to qualify the prospect for further contact after the event.</p><p><b>Customer engagement</b></p><p>The preparation and suitability of company event representatives should not be underestimated. Eighty per cent of the success of our stand will be down to how staff engage with those who enquire on the stand. Ask anyone (not specifically in a sales career) any they’ll probably agree that the idea of ‘selling’, ‘creating rapport’ or understanding ‘customer engagement’ in order to make the event a success is a daunting prospect.</p><ul><li> Event staff should be people orientated, enthusiastic, confident and professional</li><li> Be knowledgeable about the company and relevant products and services</li><li>Be good listeners</li></ul><p><b>Basics of Selling at events</b></p><p>To help staff do this, review the three basic steps to selling at exhibitions:</p><p>1. Sell yourself,</p><p>2. Sell your company,</p><p>3. Sell your product or service.</p><p>For some of the team, the big problem is "selling yourself" in the exhibition environment and this is where some coaching about greeting strangers helps tremendously. Also, assess each individual’s people and language skills, and be prepared to work a little more with those who may not be comfortable meeting people. Some companies use a buddy system, teaming a self-conscious or shy person with a more outgoing one, who acts as coach. Others match sales people with technical people, to create a winning combination. And, all successful exhibiting companies hold daily staff meetings to build team spirit.</p><p>Next, "selling the company" phase was underway long before the show opened. Exhibitions are part of your company's marketing mix, so all the branding on the website, the pre-show advertising, direct mail, press releases, and other promotions create a company awareness level that translates into visitor confidence and recognition in the stand. The sales and marketing messages must be consistent and fully integrated.</p><p>The final step, "selling the product," is often the easiest, since most team members have good product and services knowledge. However, moving from the product/services/consultancy discussion phase to closing the sale may not be easy to accomplish, as it’s much different than a sales call in the prospect’s office, because you have only a few minutes to bring the prospect into the stand, qualify her or him, have a meaningful discussion, get the lead or sale information, and then disengage. The more comfortable our event sales team members are with exhibition marketing basics, the more successful they will be at the show.</p><p><b>After the event - following up</b></p><p>Review the event in detail with all who were involved as soon as the event is over. Create contact lists while the event experience is still fresh to everyone. Showcase event successes and learn where you can do better at the next event.</p><p>Follow up with your new leads within a few days of the exhibition. Make sure you follow-up all your leads at least six times after the show over the following three months. If you have the resources – make the contact personal.</p><p>A personalised message is so much more memorable and will do wonders for the perception of you and your brand. Thank every customer who came to your stand to see you.</p><p>Send out an email or enews item about the show (and any competition results) to everyone that visited the show on the day. Send this and also to all those who were invited. Include links to show literature and new case studies that may be of interest to customers who were just not able to go but are interesting in finding out what more we can offer.</p><p>Establish how to pass on your event experience to other business stakeholders.</p><p>Finally use your email crm system to see how many people you invited who were not able to attend. Send them an invitation to learn about everything that passed at the event. Link them to your post-event microsite so they are able to download all the material that was available at the show. Updated about your organisation’s continuing improvement and commitment to customer service, your customers and prospects will value your organisation, service, products even more highly and you’ll be more memorable to them too.</p><p>Work out the number of customer contacts you made and the cost using your event contact performance information from your event campaign. As the prospects turn into valuable new contracts record the value of the new business. That will be your benchmark for the next event and valuable substantiation when lobbying for funds for the next event.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="17"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="18"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="19"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="20"><span data-reactid="21"><!-- react-empty: 22 --><h2 data-reactid="23"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="24"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="27"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
