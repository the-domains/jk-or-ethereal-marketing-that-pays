___"We no longer make or move things; we apply knowledge to knowledge."___

Peter Drucker

Events - the decision-maker's number one choice.

Exhibitions and events represent a truly an outstanding marketing opportunity.

Exhibitions and events are the best face-to-face marketing opportunity for companies around the world. They provide outstanding sales, marketing, research, branding and financial rewards for companies that understand some important exhibition marketing fundamentals.

Executive decision-makers consistently rank exhibitions as their "Number One" choice for obtaining purchasing information -- beating 12 other business media choices, including direct mail, advertising, telemarketing and even email marketing. Exhibitions are the only sales and marketing medium that delivers a pre-qualified visitor to your company's stand in a face-to-face selling environment. And these visitors invest their own valuable time and expenses to be at the exhibition.

Peter Drucker, in his book Post Capitalist Society, calls this new century the age of specialisation and knowledge. "We no longer make or move things; we apply knowledge to knowledge." Exhibitions and events are the prime opportunity to accomplish this.
